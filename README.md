# NextJS Authentication with Amazon Cognito

This project is built on top of NextJS and is integrated with Amazon Cognito to provide Auth functionality such as signup, signin, and password reset.

## Amazon Cognito

For the Authentication features to work, you must have an AWS account to use the Cognito service.

Create a Cognito User pool, App client, and setup the domain.

Finally, open the filw src/aws-export.js and update the values being asked.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/signin) with your browser to see the result.
